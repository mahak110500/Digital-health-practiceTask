In this process, 1,600 MHz of spectrum will be tendered, four times more than what has been tendered in the entire history of the sector. This will mean an estimated investment of US$ 3,000 million in the next 5 years, allowing 10 times the speed of navigation and having 100 times more capacity than current 4G networks.nnThe implementation of 5G technology will allow Chile to enter the world of the Internet of Things and achieve advances in the field of smart cities, modernization of the State, telemedicine, production and distribution of goods and services. Likewise, Chile is promoting digital highways, through the National Fiber Optic, the Southern Fiber Optic and the Fiber Optic cable that will connect Chile and South America with Asia and Oceania."

The Health in allnPolicies approach in Chile has been systematically led by the Foros Regionales de SaludnPública (Regional Public Health Forums) since 2014. The Foros Regionales bringntogether regional authorities along with representatives of the community to developnstrategic plans and actions. For example, Foros have been working to prevent Hepatitis B,nimprove PAP and mammography rates, reduce. nnThis chapter sheds light on the organisation of the Chilean territory and its distributionnof regulatory powers. It looks at how in most OECD member countries, different levels ofngovernment coexist and how they deal with the each one’s set of rules and attributions. Itnexplains why promoting regulatory quality at the sub-national level would benefit citizensnand business, especially with the ongoing initiatives of decentralization. It furtherndescribes the multi-level regulatory framework necessary to design, implement, andnenforce regulation in order for one level not to undermine the other level’s regulatoryneffectiveness. Finally, it proposes a multi-level co-ordination mechanism in order tonattain regulatory goals, as well as sharing good practices and possible learningnexperiences."

The ministry also partners with the Statistics Ministry (INE) to improve data collection, develop new metrics, and  elevate analysis of the health sector. Within the health sector, the new API framework greatly simplifies the acquisition of data, which in turn unlocks the value of big data and analysis technologies that yield better insight.MINSAL has found that social determinants greatly influence health decisions: choices in food, selection of facilities, participation in social circles, etc. By tapping into the wider ecosystem of software developers in Chile, new solutions could measurably affect underserved populations and change behavior. For example, data from the Ministry of Education of Chile (MINEDUC) could be mashed up with MINSAL data as well as data from other APIs to create useful applications and insights. One specific area of interest is raising awareness of the nutritional profiles of traditional and packaged foods, not only using labeling and information standards, but also integrating this information into the classroom and the daily lifestyles of families."
